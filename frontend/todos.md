# TODO'S

- [ ] add validation for Model Type and Purpose at /models/new
- [ ] Check if the Unique Reference input should be shown or just remove it overall
- [ ] How do we want to mock in the meantime the Acc exec - usage, owner and user to be got from HR populated searchable dropdown? should I mock it in my backend or is it overkill? would help to implement the searchable dropdown. That's the best way to implement this? make api calls from the dropdown itself in evey stroke with debaunce? or get the whole table for each dropdown and show it all at once?
