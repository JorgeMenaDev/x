# Use Case

Model relationships

# Goals

1. Setup a series of model relationships
2. Show how model relationships can be viewed or reported

# Steps

1. Record a series of relationships between models va the user interface
   -- in this example (imagen attached) the output from model z is used as input to models P & Q, also the output from model Q is used as input to model R and the output from model S has both a use for reporting and as an input to model Q.
2. Add / Edit another model relationship (live in demo to stakeholders) --- we should be able to do this.
3. Show how the user can review model relationships including visualisation of the interdependencies.
   -- Oportunity to showcase different ways model relationships can be found and reviewed in your solution.
