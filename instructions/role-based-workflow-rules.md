# Role-Based Workflow Rules

The workflow itself would need to enforce specific role-based rules:

1. Validators:

- Can see all models due for validation
- Can record validation results and upload documents
- Cannot attest to their own validations

2. Model Owners:

- Can only see and attest to their own models
- Cannot modify validation results
- Must review and attest to validation findings

3. Stakeholders:

- Can view validation results but not modify them
- Can see impact analysis for models that affect their areas

4. Admins:

- Have full access to all features
- Can override workflow steps in exceptional cases

This role-based implementation ensures that users can only access the parts of the system relevant to their responsibilities, improving security and creating a more focused user experience.
